Grids_galactic_models
=====================

* We fit galactic models to our data with a grid of possible values for the parameters, 
except the central density, which is a free parameter.

* We also fit the same galactic models to our data with a continuous range for all the 
parameters, which are free (unconstrained).

* In these notebooks We study the results of the gridded fits and compare them to the free best fits.
